## ðŸ“Œ Overview

SmartInsureAI is an end-to-end machine learning system designed to automate and optimize the process of vehicle insurance risk assessment. It addresses real-world challenges faced by insurers such as manual workflows, fraud detection, and lack of scalable infrastructure by integrating data ingestion, model training, cloud deployment, and CI/CD automation into a production-ready pipeline.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Insurance companies struggle with outdated, manual risk assessment systems that are prone to human error, fraud, and inefficiency. Many ML solutions fail due to poor deployment strategies or lack of automation.

---

## âœ… Proposed Solution

SmartInsureAI delivers a complete machine learning lifecycle system that:

- Ingests vehicle insurance data into a **cloud-hosted MongoDB**.
- Performs **data cleaning, validation, and transformation**.
- Trains ML models to assess **claim risk** or **fraud probability**.
- Deploys a **FastAPI** to serve real-time predictions.
- Utilizes **AWS (S3 & EC2)** for cloud hosting and model artifact storage.
- Implements **Docker** and **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD.
